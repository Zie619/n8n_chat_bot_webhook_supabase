# UI Overflow Fix Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. ChatInterface.tsx
- Removed conflicting `max-h-[calc(100vh-400px)]` from message history container
- Added `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900` to the input form for consistent styling
- Kept `min-h-0` and `overflow-y-auto` for proper scrolling

### 2. ArticleEditor.tsx
- Changed main container from `h-screen` to `h-full` to prevent viewport overflow
- Removed `max-h-[calc(100vh-200px)]` from content area
- Added `overflow-hidden` to textarea container div
- Added `overflow-y-auto min-h-0` to textarea for proper scrolling
- Added `flex flex-col` to chat interface container

### 3. Sidebar.tsx
- Changed from `h-screen` to `h-full` to work properly within flex container

### 4. Layout Structure (page.tsx)
- Main container uses `h-screen` with proper flex layout
- Header is fixed height
- Content area uses `flex-1 overflow-hidden`
- Sidebar and ArticleEditor are contained within the flex layout

## Key Principles Applied:
1. Used `h-full` instead of `h-screen` for child components
2. Applied `overflow-hidden` to parent containers
3. Used `overflow-y-auto` on scrollable content areas
4. Added `min-h-0` to flex children to allow proper shrinking
5. Avoided fixed height calculations that can break on different screen sizes

## Testing:
- Test with long article content
- Test with many chat messages
- Test on different screen sizes
- Test with browser zoom levels

The UI should now properly contain content within viewport bounds without pushing elements off-screen.
